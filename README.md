MySQL Docker Image
==================

These are the resources to build the [MySQL Docker image] that you will find at
[my Docker Hub profile].


Motivation
----------

The [oficial MySQL image] from the Docker library is just too big. This version
uses [Alpine Linux] as a base image with a small footprint.
